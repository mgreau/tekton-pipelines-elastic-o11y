== Tekton Pipelines Tutorials

The *link:./pipeline-elastic[`pipeline-elastic`]* folder contains several examples using *tekton Tasks and Pipelines*. +
The Elastic components (Elasticsearch, Beats and Kibana) are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster to collect the logs and metrics
from the pods deployed by tekton. +
The tekton components deployed are the official ones. There is no need to update those components to monitor them using the Elastic Stack.

* link:./pipeline-elastic/README.adoc#hello-world[`pipeline-elastic/01-hello-world`] contains a *Task* and a *TaskRun* to print Hello World
* link:./pipeline-elastic/README.adoc#kaniko-hello-world---dockerhub[`pipeline-elastic/02-kaniko-push-dockerhub`] contains a *Task* and a *TaskRun* to build and push a Docker image from a git repository using Kaniko 

=== Set up

[source,shell]
--
# make sure you are using the right k8s context
$ kubectl config current-context
docker-for-desktop

# install all the components
$ ./pipeline-elastic/scripts/set-up-env.sh init
--

Then wait until the pods are running before starting the tutorials

[source,shell]
--
# Check Elastic pods
$ kubectl get pods -w -n elastic-stack

# Check tekton Build Pipeline pods
$ kubectl get pods -w -n tekton-pipelines
NAME                                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
tekton-pipelines-controller-77f74f5bcf-rbj8s   1/1     Running   0          1m
tekton-pipelines-webhook-f76c97965-5xkxq       1/1     Running   0          1m
--

=== Get Access to Kibana

When the set-up is done, you should have a *Kibana pod up and running*:

[source,shell]
--
# Check Elastic pods
$ kubectl get pods -n elastic-stack
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
elasticsearch-7bf6cd96cd-r6llt       1/1       Running   0          4m
filebeat-5lrwg                       1/1       Running   0          4m
kibana-694998774-dxwgm               1/1       Running   0          4m
kube-state-metrics-b8845b4d7-ch9v7   1/1       Running   0          4m
metricbeat-zctb6                     1/1       Running   0          4m
--

Then you can access to the http://localhost:30601/app/infra#/home?_g=()&waffleOptions=(groupBy:!(),metric:(type:cpu),nodeType:pod)[Kibana Infrastructure app]:
