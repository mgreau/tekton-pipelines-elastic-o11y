== Prerequisite

For now, these tutorials have only been tested on a laptop with Docker Desktop 2.0.0 with kubernetes enabled on Mac OS.

== Knative Pipeline Tutorials

The *link:./pipeline-elastic[`pipeline-elastic`]* folder contains several examples using *Knative Tasks and Pipelines*. +
The Elastic components (Elasticsearch, Beats and Kibana) are deployed to the Kubernetes cluster to collect the logs and metrics
from the pods deployed by Knative. +
The Knative components deployed are the official ones. There is no need to update those components to monitor them using the Elastic Stack.

* link:./pipeline-elastic/README.adoc#hello-world[`pipeline-elastic/01-hello-world`] contains a *Task* and a *TaskRun* to print Hello World
* [TODO] `pipeline-elastic/02-kaniko-build-push` contains a *Pipeline* to build and push a Docker image from a git repository using Kaniko (source to url example)
* [TODO] `pipeline-elastic/02-gradle-build` contains a *Resource (git)*, a *Task* and a *TaskRun* to build a Gradle project


=== Set up

[source,shell]
--
# make sure you are using the right k8s context
$ kubectl config current-context
docker-for-desktop

# install all the components
$ ./pipeline-elastic/scripts/set-up-env.sh init
--

Then wait until the pods are running before starting the tutorials

[source,shell]
--
# Check Elastic pods
$ kubectl get pods -w -n default

# Check Knative Build Pipeline pods
$ kubectl get pods -w -n knative-build-pipeline
--

=== Get Access to Kibana

When the set-up is done, you should have a *Kibana pod up and running*:

[source,shell]
--
# Check Elastic pods
$ kubectl get pods -n default
NAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
elasticsearch-7bf6cd96cd-r6llt       1/1       Running   0          4m
filebeat-5lrwg                       1/1       Running   0          4m
kibana-694998774-dxwgm               1/1       Running   0          4m
kube-state-metrics-b8845b4d7-ch9v7   1/1       Running   0          4m
metricbeat-zctb6                     1/1       Running   0          4m
--

Then you can access to the http://localhost:30601/app/infra#/home?_g=()&waffleOptions=(groupBy:!(),metric:(type:cpu),nodeType:pod)[Kibana Infrastructure app]:
